/*  jsonConfig.h

This header should be used with the jsonMessenger library to define all the working states & commands that can be decoded by the jsonMessenger system.

This library is designed to parse commands recieved via the Serial object in Arduino. Commands should be formatted in CMD:VALUE pairs as follows:

Version 1 -> succinct command structure
`{"CMD":"VALUE"}` -> for CMDs with passed values
or
`{"CMD":} -> for CMDs with no additional values
note: in the 2nd example, any data entered after : will be ignored, as we have already defined the datatypes that will be passed with each command to the parser

Version 2 -> Verbose command structure
`{"set":"CMD","to":"VALUE"} -> for CMDs with passed values
or
`{"set":"CMD"} -> for CMDs with no additional data.

As the libary works via parsing JSON structures, any additional key:value pairs will simply be ignored, as long as the overal JSON structure is validated, the parser will just look
for the existance of matching keys, and ignore anything else.


Please see: https://github.com/ImogenWren/jsonMessenger_library for latest version and usage instructions, or follow the numbered comments for an
explanation of how to modify this template for other uses. 

All modifications should be carried out in this header file `jsonConfig.h`, please do not modify jsonMessenger.h or jsonMessenger.cpp!
