# jsonMessenger_library
 Library for easy configuration of a JSON based Serial messaging system for Arduino

_This library has been developed to simplify the implementation of transfer of control data from a user interface, over Serial connections to embedded projects running state machines._

It works by associating different keywords used to define commands sent by a user or user interface, with a list of known states, that could represent all, or some of the various states of a state machine, and 
a list of the expected variable types to be sent along with the defined keywords.



 ## Use
 This library is configured for different users entirely within the `jsonConfig.h` file.
